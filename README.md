New Disk Usage. This is an effort to create a program to show the disk usage
in an interactive way, much like how [Baobab](http://www.marzocca.net/linux/baobab/)
works.

Very much a work in progress.

## Targeted features:

Non exhaustive list of features.

1. Interactive view (with ncurses this time? :-))
1. Fancy colors.
1. Select directory, makes it expand.
1. Sort by size (largest first).
1. ... and more when I can think of it.
